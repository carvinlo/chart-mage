### Tech
Many thanks to the cool projects [mermaid](https://mermaidjs.github.io/), [Codemirror](https://codemirror.net/), [Underscore](https://underscorejs.org/), [node-uuid](https://github.com/broofa/node-uuid), [jQuery Modal](https://jquerymodal.com/), [base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16). Chart Mage was made possible by them.

### Note
I built Chart Mage three years ago when I taught myself to code. The code is messy and the comments are in Chinese. So the next thing I will do is to tidy up the code and translate the comments into English.
